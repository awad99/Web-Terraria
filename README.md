# Web Terraria

The Terraria experience — right in your browser.
Web Terraria is a full 2D sandbox adventure game, inspired by the original Terraria, rebuilt from the ground up to run entirely on the web. No downloads, no installs — just open your browser and play.

Powered by a custom Entity-Component-System (ECS), a hand-crafted math library, and modern rendering with WebGL and WebGPU, it’s designed for smooth performance, modularity, and a true Terraria-style gameplay loop: digging, building, crafting, and fighting — all online.

Do you want me to make it sound more like a game announcement (focused on gameplay) or keep it technical (focused on engine and code)?
